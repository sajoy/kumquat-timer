## Contribute
1. Fork and clone the code
1. Get to know the code
    - Read through `app.js` and `index.html` to get a sense of what is happening where and what code is doing what.
    - Some questions to think about while you're reading:
        - What models or constructor functions do we have?
        - How is our JavaScript code organized?
        - Is there repetitive code you can refactor?
        - Is there HTML being created programmatically (in our JS)?
        - What events are we listening to and what are we doing in their handlers?
        - What code runs when we create a new timer?
        - What code runs when we start a timer?
1. Pick something to work on 
    - Refactor: make the code more DRY, move around code so it makes more sense, rename variables, etc.
    - Stretch goal: pick a stretch goal from [USER_STORIES.md](USER_STORIES.md) and complete it.
    - Create a new feature: come up with a new feature and add it to the app.
1. Make a PR
    - To ensure this app stays intro-level friendly, your PR will only be considered if it satisfies the following:
        - Only uses Vanilla JS DOM manipulation.
        - Minimal use of other libraries.
        - No use of ES2015 features.
    - If you don't want to make a PR, but still want to share your version of kumquat-timer, add your app's info to our [FORKS.md](FORKS.md) file following the example within it.
