### Stretch Goals

- As a user I want to see the time remaining in the browser tab.
- As a user I want the clocks to account for hours (1:30:00 instead of 90:00).
- As a user I want to update my settings: whether I want a timer modal or just a timer to the side of the list.
- As a user I want to give a timer a sound or URL to open when it's finished.
- As a developer I want to check the remaining time against a Date object rather than using setInterval to change runTime for more accuracy.
